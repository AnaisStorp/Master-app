# 🧠 Project: Convolutional Neural Networks (French) 🇫🇷  

This project focuses on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification**.  
All materials, including the Jupyter Notebook and final report, are **written in French**.  

📌 **Topics Covered:**  
- Deep learning with CNNs  
- Image classification using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Training and optimizing neural networks  

📂 **Files Included:**  
- `KerasMnist.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with Python code  

📝 *This project was completed as part of my academic coursework, demonstrating my ability to work with deep learning models and image recognition.*
